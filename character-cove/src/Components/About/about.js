            <h1> ABOUT ROOSTER</h1>
            Howdy! I'm Rooster (wow really), and for several years I have had a strong love for creating characters of my own! Currently I am trying to get a degree in web development and am making this all on my lonesome. A big problem I noticed a while ago within the OC community is the lack of places to store and share your characters that you put so much work into, or a place to talk to others and get help/ideas for your characters! I can't wait to see what people do with this when I am finally done and able to use it (if you're reading this I would like to think this is open to the public now :]).
